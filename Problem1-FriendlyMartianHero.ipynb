    "In this problem, we explored two fundamental AI inference techniques: forward chaining and backward chaining, applied within a first-order logic knowledge base. Forward chaining, a data-driven approach, systematically derives new facts, while backward chaining, a goal-driven method, works backward from queries to validate conditions. By comparing both approaches, we gained insights into their efficiency, applicability, and differences in reasoning.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also developed hands-on experience with knowledge representation, unification, and inference rule application. These exercises underscored the importance of structured logical reasoning in AI and demonstrated how rule-based systems can model complex relationships and support automated decision-making."
